# Installation process
The installation process involves cloning this repository, installing mysql-server, running this website and installing tailwind whic is used for styling.
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Install mysql-server and create a database named 'django_lms'. For those using linux, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04) to install mysql-server.
3. Note the password you have assigned to the root user you will need it later.
4. Open the project in your favorite code editor 
5. Delete the existing virtualenv folder then ,open terminal then create a virtual Environment using the command `python3 -m venv virtualenv`.
6. Activate the virtual environment using the command `source virtualenv/bin/activate`.
7. Install the requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
8. Open the settings.py file in the django_lms folder of  the project and change the password in the database dictionary to the password you assigned to the root user. 

    this is how the database dictionary should look like after changing the password.
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'django_lms',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password_type_here',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }

9. Run the command `python manage.py makemigrations` then `python manage.py migrate` to create the tables in the database.
10. Then install tailwind for django using this commands: 
```python
python -m pip install django-tailwind[reload]
python manage.py tailwind install #ensures tailwind dependencies are installed

```

11. Finally to run the project use the command `python manage.py tailwind start` in one terminal then open another terminal in the same directory and ensure you are in the virtual environment by typing `source virtualenv/bin/activate`. then the command : `python manage.py runserver` to run the website.
12. Open your browser and type `localhost:8000` in the address bar to view the website.
