# cookiecutter

A command-line utility that creates projects from **cookiecutters** (project templates), e.g. creating a Python package project from a Python package project template.

- Documentation: [https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io)
- GitHub: [https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/)
- Free and open source software: [BSD license](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE)


## Features

- Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux are officially supported.
- You don't have to know/write Python code to use Cookiecutter.
- Works with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Project templates can be in any programming language or markup format:
  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, CoffeeScript, RST, Markdown, CSS, HTML, you name it.
  You can use multiple languages in the same project template.

### For users of existing templates

- Simple command line usage:

  ```bash
  # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
  # You'll be prompted to enter values.
  # Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,
  # based on those values.
  $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
  # For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix
  $ cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
  ```

- Use it at the command line with a local template:

  ```bash
  # Create project in the current working directory, from the local
  # cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
  $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
  ```

- Or use it from Python:

  ```py
  from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

  # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
  cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

  # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
  cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')
  ```

- Unless you suppress it with `--no-input`, you are prompted for input:
  - Prompts are the keys in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Default responses are the values in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Prompts are shown in order.
- Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:

  ```yaml
  default_context:
    full_name: "Audrey Roy Greenfeld"
    email: "audreyr@gmail.com"
    github_username: "audreyfeldroy"
  cookiecutters_dir: "~/.cookiecutters/"
  ```

- Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.
- If you have already cloned a cookiecutter into `~/.cookiecutters/`,  you can reference it by directory name:

  ```bash
  # Clone cookiecutter-pypackage
  $ cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
  # Now you can use the already cloned cookiecutter by name
  $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage
  ```

- You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git repos or Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.
- Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want to be used as defaults whenever you generate a project.
- Inject extra context with command-line arguments:

  ```bash
  cookiecutter --no-input gh:msabramo/cookiecutter-supervisor program_name=foobar startsecs=10
  ```

- Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for the injection of extra context.
- Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.
Projects are generated to your current directory or to the target directory if specified with `-o` option.

### For template creators

- Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.
- 100% of templating is done with Jinja2.
- Both, directory names and filenames can be templated.
  For example:

  ```py
  {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py
  ```
- Simply define your template variables in a `cookiecutter.json` file. You can also add human-readable questions and choices that will be prompted to the user for each variable using the `__prompts__` key.
  For example:

  ```json
  {
    "full_name": "Audrey Roy Greenfeld",
    "email": "audreyr@gmail.com",
    "project_name": "Complexity",
    "repo_name": "complexity",
    "project_short_description": "Refreshingly simple static site generator.",
    "release_date": "2013-07-10",
    "year": "2013",
    "version": "0.1.1",
    "linting": ["ruff", "flake8", "none"],
    "__prompts__": {
      "full_name": "Provide your full name",
      "email": "Provide your email",
      "linting": {
        "__prompt__": "Which linting tool do you want to use?",
        "ruff": "Ruff",
        "flake8": "Flake8",
        "none": "No linting tool"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after generating a project.

## Available Cookiecutters

Making great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors.
We're so pleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose from.
We hope you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.

### A Pantry Full of Cookiecutters

The best place to start searching for specific and ready-to-use cookiecutter templates is [Github search](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories).
Just type `cookiecutter` and you will discover over 4000 related repositories.

We also recommend you check related GitHub topics.
For general search use [cookiecutter-template](https://github.com/topics/cookiecutter-template).
For specific topics try to use `cookiecutter-yourtopic`, like `cookiecutter-python` or `cookiecutter-datascience`.
This is a new GitHub feature, so not all active repositories use it at the moment.

If you are a template developer please add related [topics](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) with `cookiecutter` prefix to your repository.
We believe it will make it more discoverable.
You are almost not limited in topic amount, use it!

## Community

The core committer team can be found in the [authors' section](AUTHORS.md).
We are always welcome and invite you to participate.

Stuck? Try one of the following:

- See the [Troubleshooting](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html) page.
- Ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cookiecutter).
- You are strongly encouraged to [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) about the problem.
  Do it even if it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your cookiecutter.
  Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.
- Ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9BrxzPKuEW) if you must (but please try one of the other options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion).

Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven:

- Huge thanks to all the [contributors](AUTHORS.md) who have pitched in to help make Cookiecutter an even better tool.
- Everyone is invited to contribute.
  Read the [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md), then get started.
- Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9BrxzPKuEW)
  (note: due to work and other commitments, a core committer might not always be available)

Encouragement is unbelievably motivating.
If you want more work done on Cookiecutter, show support:

- Thank a core committer for their efforts.
- Star [Cookiecutter on GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
- [Support this project](#support-this-project)

Got criticism or complaints?

- [File an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) so that Cookiecutter can be improved.
  Be friendly and constructive about what could be better.
  Make detailed suggestions.
- **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.**
  For example, if you are discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, [file an issue](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen) where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on the email.
- Be encouraging.
  A comment like "This function ought to be rewritten like this" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like "Eww, look how bad this function is."

Waiting for a response to an issue/question?

- Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through.
  If urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.
- Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc.
- Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours.
- Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait?
  [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) is available for hire for consultation or custom development.
