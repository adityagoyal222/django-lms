Pinax
------
Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.


django-forms-bootstrap
-----------------------

``django-forms-bootstrap`` is a simple bootstrap filter for Django forms. Extracted from the
bootstrap theme for Pinax.


Getting Started
-----------

Include ``django-forms-bootstrap`` in your requirements file and
``django_forms_bootstrap`` in your ``INSTALLED APPS``.

Make sure your template loader finders includes app directories.

To style forms, add the following to the top of your template ::

    {% load bootstrap_tags %}

and include your form using something like the following markup: ::

    <form>
        <legend>My Form</legend>
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form|as_bootstrap }}
        <div class="form-actions">
          <a href="#back" class="btn">Go back</a>
          <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
        </div>
    </form>


Specifying Form Layouts
-----------------------

Bootstrap includes styles for three types of forms. To change the display of
your form, add one of the following class attributes to your form tag and
use the appropriate template filter:

================   ======================================   ========================================
    Class          Template filter                                Description
================   ======================================   ========================================
.form-vertical     ``{{ form|as_bootstrap }}``              Labels over controls (default)
.form-horizontal   ``{{ form|as_bootstrap_horizontal }}``   Labels on same line as controls
.form-inline       ``{{ form|as_bootstrap_inline }}``       Compact style with inline-block controls
================   ======================================   ========================================
